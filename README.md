### Consumer Behavior Analysis

| SQL Project | [Consumer Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/Consumer_Behavior_Analysis) |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| Goals | The purpose of this project is to be part of an ongoing process to refine and develop my data analysis skills. In this customer analysis, I will use SQL to discover new insights within the dataset to better understand the customers and their purchasing preferences. Key areas of focus include finding the primary demographic, and their product preferences. |
| Description | The Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset provides a detailed overview of consumer preferences and purchasing behaviors. It includes demographic information, purchase history, product preferences, and preferred shopping channels. This dataset is essential for businesses aiming to tailor their strategies to meet customer needs and enhance their shopping experience, ultimately driving sales and loyalty. This project was originally completed using the MySQL platform and the original dataset formatting has been adjusted and cleaned to work on the MySQL platform. |
